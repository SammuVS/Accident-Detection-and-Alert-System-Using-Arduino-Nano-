# Accident-Detection-and-Alert-System-Using-Arduino-Nano-
We built a simple, low-cost safety system that tries to prevent accidents by using a REES52 IR sensor to instantly stop the motor through an L298N when an obstacle appears. If a collision still occurs, the ADXL335 accelerometer detects the impact and activates a buzzer and LED to alert nearby people for immediate help.
